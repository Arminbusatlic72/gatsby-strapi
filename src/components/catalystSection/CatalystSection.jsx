            Catalyst is an AI software application development tool that
            empowers one or more subject matter experts, who are not programmers
            or techies, to quickly create valuable knowledge basis i many
            domains. The experts use Catalyst to create question, answers,
            scenarios, standards and rules (IF-THEN-ELSE statements) then
            associate each answer with one or more rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowledge basis build with Catalyst can be deployed into production
            immediately, even after one hour of knowledge input by the expert.
            Application access knowledge bases and a patented rule engine that
            analyzes facts provided by non-experts and data stored within data
            bases, searches for fact patterns the suggests one or more
            appropriate solutions to the none expert. The results can be
            displayed as text, reports, decisions, or other desired output, all
            of which are correct, complete, consisted and timely.
          </p>

            Changing paradigms and standards, modeling expert decision-making,
            reengineering inefficient processes, educating and training,
            fine-tuning critical policies, and creating ideal models are a few
            waysAI applications build with a Catalyst create leverage and effect
